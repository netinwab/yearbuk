I want to fully add PDF yearbook support alongside the existing image-based uploads, with a proper setup choice when schools first configure a yearbook.
Here’s what to do:


---

1. 📄 Setup Flow (Frontend)

On the initial yearbook setup window (where schools currently choose orientation — portrait or landscape), add a new option:

“Upload Mode”: choose between
Image Uploads (existing system) or PDF Uploads (new system).


This upload mode should be stored in the yearbook schema under:

uploadType: "image" | "pdf"

The uploadType selection should appear before or alongside orientation, and both values should be saved together once the setup is complete.

The setup modal should still only appear once per yearbook (controlled by isInitialized).



---

2. ⚙️ School Upload (Backend)

The PDF upload feature already exists, but it’s currently mixed in with the image upload system. Separate the logic clearly:

If uploadType === "pdf", enable PDF upload.

If uploadType === "image", enable the current multi-image upload.


When a PDF is uploaded:

Split it into individual page images (JPG or PNG) using a supported library (pdf-lib, pdfjs, or equivalent).

Save each page image in the same structure as the image-based uploads so everything else works consistently.

No front or back cover constants are required for PDF uploads (since the file already contains all pages).

Each split page should be numbered automatically for the table of contents feature.




---

3. 🧭 Yearbook Management (School Dashboard)

When a school uploads a PDF:

Display generated page thumbnails at the bottom of the yearbook-manage page (same layout as image uploads).

These thumbnails are not editable or re-orderable (PDFs are already pre-arranged).


When a school uploads images (the regular way), all existing functionality remains unchanged.

The yearbook management interface should automatically switch between the image mode and PDF mode depending on uploadType.



---

4. 👀 Viewer Experience (Frontend)

For viewers/alumni:

Yearbooks uploaded as PDFs should appear exactly the same as image-based ones.

The flipbook, grid view, or 2-page spread view should still work properly — the source of the pages shouldn’t matter.

Viewers should not be able to tell whether a yearbook came from a PDF or from image uploads.




---

5. ⚡ Integration & Clean-Up

Ensure this new system integrates seamlessly with existing yearbook data and doesn’t break anything.

Treat PDF yearbooks as just another upload type.

Preserve existing functionality for table of contents, page numbering, and viewing.

Remove any redundant or duplicate code related to the old combined PDF/image system.

Keep all current UI styling consistent with the rest of the app.

✅ Notes

The PDF upload code partially exists — don’t recreate it. Just separate it cleanly into its own conditional system and connect it to uploadType.

This update adds a cleaner setup process and gives schools full control to pick their upload format from the start.
