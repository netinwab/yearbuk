Prompt for Replit AI — Full Yearbook Configuration System Overhaul (Pre-Purchase Setup + Smart Management)

I want to completely replace the current post-purchase setup system with a pre-purchase configuration dialog for yearbooks.

The current setup page that appears after purchasing a year should be fully removed.
The new system should let schools configure everything before buying, similar to selecting toppings before ordering a pizza.


---

⚙️ 1. Remove the Old System

Delete or disable all logic related to the old setup window that appears after clicking “Manage.”

Remove any conditions like !yearbook.orientation, !yearbook.isInitialized, or any setup-triggered reloads.

The isInitialized field can stay in the schema for compatibility but should no longer be used.

The setup page and any popups tied to it must be completely removed.



---

🧩 2. Add a New “Year Purchase Configuration” Dialog (Before Purchase)

When a school selects a year to buy, instead of showing the small “add to cart” popup, display a larger interactive configuration dialog that includes all setup options and price confirmation in one place.

Dialog Fields

a. Yearbook Type (Required)

Selection input (radio buttons or toggle):

Image Upload (JPG/PNG)

PDF Upload



b. Orientation (Required)

Options:

Landscape

Portrait



c. Price Display

Display the price of the selected year, just like the current small dialog.


d. Add to Cart Button

Button text:

> “Confirm and Add to Cart”



Disabled until both type and orientation are selected.



---

🛒 3. Integration with Cart and Purchase Flow

When “Confirm and Add to Cart” is clicked:

The selected preferences (yearbookType and orientation) are stored in a temporary cart object tied to that year.

When checkout completes, those preferences are saved permanently in the Yearbook record.


If the item is deleted from the cart:

The year’s configuration (type + orientation) is wiped.

If the same year is added again, the configuration dialog appears again and must be re-filled.

This ensures that schools always confirm their settings before each purchase.



---

💾 4. Database & Schema Updates

In the Yearbook schema:

Add yearbookType: string — values: "pdf" or "image"

Keep orientation: string — values: "portrait" or "landscape"

Stop using isInitialized for logic (it can stay in schema for legacy reasons).

Ensure the above two fields are stored when the yearbook is purchased — not afterward.



---

🧠 5. Yearbook Management (Auto Detection)

After purchase, when the school clicks Manage:

The system should auto-detect which type of yearbook (PDF or image) was selected and render the appropriate management interface:


If yearbookType = "image":

Load the existing image upload interface.

Keep all current features (page arrangement, front/back covers, thumbnails, etc).


If yearbookType = "pdf":

Show a simpler PDF upload interface:

A single “Upload PDF” button (file picker).

When a PDF is uploaded, automatically split the PDF into individual page images using a library like pdf-lib, pdfjs, or pdf-poppler depending on what’s available in the setup.

Display thumbnails of generated pages (not editable).

No front or back cover constants required.

Number the pages properly so the Table of Contents still works.




---

🎨 6. Viewer Experience (Frontend)

For viewers/alumni:

They should not notice any difference between PDF-based and image-based yearbooks.

The viewer interface (flipbook or two-page spread) should behave identically regardless of upload type.

The only backend difference is how the pages were uploaded and stored.



---

💬 7. UI/UX Design Details

The pre-purchase configuration dialog should be clean, centered, and easy to use.

Include clear headers like:

“Select Yearbook Type”

“Choose Orientation”

“Confirm Purchase”


The layout should resemble a modern e-commerce product configuration (like selecting laptop specs or pizza toppings).

Display the total price clearly before confirmation.

Ensure responsive design for both desktop and mobile views.

🧾 8. Behavior Summary

1. School selects a year → configuration dialog appears.


2. School selects yearbook type (PDF or image) and orientation (portrait or landscape).


3. School clicks Confirm and Add to Cart → preferences saved temporarily.


4. School checks out → Yearbook record created with those preferences saved.


5. When the school clicks Manage, the system automatically opens the correct management interface (PDF or image).


6. If the school removes the year from cart, configuration resets and must be re-done when re-added.


7. For existing yearbooks from before this system, default to:

yearbookType: "image"

Keep their current orientation value.

🧰 9. Cleanup Tasks

Remove all unnecessary setup code, reload triggers, and post-purchase setup conditions.

Make sure no setup window appears after purchase.

Double-check that the “Manage” button logic routes correctly based on yearbookType.

Test thoroughly to confirm that:

PDF upload → Works fine and pages display.

Image upload → Still functions as before.

Viewer sees consistent flipbook view for both types.




---

✅ 10. Final Goal

After this update:

No more setup after purchase.

Schools configure everything before buying.

The Manage page auto-detects and loads the correct interface.

Removing from cart clears settings.

Everything integrates seamlessly without breaking existing yearbook or memory functions.



---

⚡ Note:
Some of these functions (like PDF uploads and cart flow) may already exist — review and reuse any existing working code where possible instead of recreating from scratch.
