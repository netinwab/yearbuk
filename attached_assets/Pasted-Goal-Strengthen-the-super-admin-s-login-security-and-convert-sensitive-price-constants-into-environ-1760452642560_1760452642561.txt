Goal: Strengthen the super admin‚Äôs login security and convert sensitive price constants into environment variables.

üõ°Ô∏è TASK 1 ‚Äî Add Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Super Admin Only

Objective: After the super admin enters their correct username and password, they must verify a one-time 6-digit code sent to their email address netonwabuisi83@gmail.com before access is granted.

Details:

After successful password entry, redirect to a new 2FA verification page.

The page should show a message like:

> ‚ÄúA 6-digit verification code has been sent to ne******3@gmail.com.‚Äù



The code should:

Be 6 digits long.

Expire after 5 minutes.

Become invalid immediately once a new code is resent.

Have a 50-second cooldown before a resend is allowed.


Add a ‚ÄúResend Code‚Äù button with proper visual feedback (e.g., disabled countdown).

Use the existing email system (Resend sandbox or live) to send the verification email.

The verification page should validate the code before granting access to the super admin dashboard.

All login attempts (successful or failed) should be logged in the super admin‚Äôs activity log for auditing.

üí≤ TASK 2 ‚Äî Convert Pricing Constants to Environment Variables

Objective: Replace hardcoded constants with environment variables for better security and flexibility.

Convert the following constants:

SCHOOL_YEAR_PRICE

BADGE_SLOT_PRICE

Any other price or commission-related constant (if any exist).


Implementation:

Move them into the .env file with names like:

SCHOOL_YEAR_PRICE=6.99
BADGE_SLOT_PRICE=0.49

Update all references in the backend code to pull from process.env.SCHOOL_YEAR_PRICE and process.env.BADGE_SLOT_PRICE.

Add fallback values (in case the environment variables are missing) to prevent runtime errors.

Confirm that both Replit and Render environments load the variables correctly.

‚úÖ Expected Result:

Super admin login now requires an email-based 2FA verification step.

Price values are no longer hardcoded; they are securely managed as environment variables.
