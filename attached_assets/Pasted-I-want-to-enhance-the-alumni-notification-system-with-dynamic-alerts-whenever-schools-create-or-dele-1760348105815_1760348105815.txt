I want to enhance the alumni notification system with dynamic alerts whenever schools create or delete upload codes.

🧩 1. Trigger Logic (Backend)

When a school account successfully creates a new upload code, trigger a backend function:

sendNotificationToVerifiedAlumni(schoolId: string, graduationYear: string, uploadCode: string, expiresAt: Date)

This function should:

Fetch all verified alumni tied to that school.

Create a notification entry for each alumni user.

Include an expiry countdown derived from expiresAt.




---

📨 2. Notification Content

Each alumni receives a notification with the following details:

Title: Upload Code from [School Name]

Body:
Graduation [Year] — [Upload Code]
Expires in [X hours/minutes]

Link: /alumni/uploads

Include a copy button beside the code to easily copy it to clipboard.


Example:

> Upload Code from Albany College
Graduation 2013 — ABC123
Expires in 4 hours
[📋 Copy Code]




---

🗄️ 3. Database (if not already present)

Use or update the existing notifications table with:

id: string
recipient_id: string
title: string
body: string
link?: string
upload_code?: string
expires_at?: Date
read: boolean
created_at: Date

upload_code stores the code value.

expires_at stores the expiration timestamp.

read defaults to false.



---

🔄 4. Auto-Deletion Logic

When a school deletes an upload code, find all notifications tied to that code and delete them automatically from the alumni dashboards.

This cleanup should happen immediately to prevent outdated codes being visible.



---

⏱️ 5. Expiration Timer Display

On the alumni frontend:

Calculate remaining time between expires_at and now.

Display dynamically:

If > 1 hour → “Expires in X hours”

If < 1 hour → “Expires in X minutes”


If expired, gray out the notification and disable the “Copy” button.



---

💬 6. Frontend (Alumni Dashboard)

Show notifications in descending order (newest first).

Each notification should show:

Title (school name)

Upload code

Expiry text

Copy button

Timestamp


Mark notification as read when opened.

Support deleting notifications manually.



---

🏫 7. School Experience

No notifications for schools.

When creating upload codes, no extra UI changes are needed — just ensure notifications trigger automatically on creation.



---

📧 8. Optional Email Notifications

Add an optional step where, when the notification is created, an email notification is also sent to verified alumni.
Use the existing email system (Resend).
The email should include:

School name

Graduation year

Upload code

Expiry time (e.g. “Expires in 6 hours”)

A “Copy Code” button that copies the code or links to the alumni upload page.


Example email subject:

> New Upload Code from Albany College




---

⚙️ 9. Performance & Cleanup

Use bulk inserts when notifying multiple alumni.

Use background processing (async) for email notifications.

Add a daily cleanup job to remove expired notifications automatically.



---

💡 Goal:
This system ensures verified alumni are instantly alerted when their school creates or deletes upload codes, showing clear expiration info and quick access (copy and upload).
