I want to add an About Page to Yearbuk.

Here‚Äôs what to do:

üß© Frontend Changes

1. On the login page, add a small button labeled ‚ÄúAbout Yearbuk‚Äù below the login form.

When clicked, it should route users to a new page: /about.

This button should match the theme and color palette of the login page.



2. Create a new route /about that displays a clean, scrollable page explaining what Yearbuk is and how it works.


3. At the top header of the About page, add a banner-style button saying:
‚ÄúDone testing? Take our survey ‚Üí‚Äù

The button should stand out and redirect to the external survey link (I‚Äôll provide it later).

Make sure this banner is responsive and stays visible on mobile screens.

What is Yearbuk?

Yearbuk is a digital yearbook platform built to bring schools, students, and alumni together in a modern, interactive way.
It reimagines traditional printed yearbooks into a simple, secure, and accessible online system that anyone can explore anytime, anywhere.

Choose between PDF uploads or image-based pages for flexibility.

Set their own yearbook prices, manage alumni requests, and track purchases.

Generate upload codes for students to submit memories and photos directly.

Communicate with verified alumni through the built-in notification system.

Enjoy full control over their content with advanced moderation tools.

Viewers and alumni can:

Search and access their school‚Äôs yearbooks instantly.

Verify their alumni status to unlock upload privileges and alumni badges.

Receive notifications when new uploads or updates are available.

Purchase and view yearbooks in a realistic page-flip experience.

Security & Verification

Yearbuk uses email verification, 2FA, and encrypted storage to ensure that all accounts and data are fully secure.
Schools must be verified by the Yearbuk moderation team before they can publish content, keeping the platform professional and authentic.

2. Alumni and viewers join to explore, view, and contribute to their class memories.


3. Yearbuk connects everyone through secure uploads, purchase systems, and community updates ‚Äî making nostalgia interactive and accessible.
